\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an integrated system EasyCompare to conduct a fair performance comparison of GNN models with various frameworks on diverse GPUs. EasyCompare incorporates GUC DSL for GNN model definition and functionally equivalent code transformation. EasyCompare also designs front-end interactions to deploy GNN models and visualize logs for performance analysis automatically. Extensive experiments conducted with EasyCompare provide useful suggestions for further optimization paths within GNN frameworks.

For future work, we would like to extend the GUC DSL to support more GNNs and frameworks. We can further extend EasyCompare to enable performance comparisons for more production scenarios (e.g., multi-GPU) to explore the directions for GNN performance optimization.

In addition, we would like to specify more details of the comparison result and add more comparison settings (e.g. comparison over multi-GPUs) to explore the factors influencing the performance of GNNs.}
