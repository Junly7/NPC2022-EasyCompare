\label{sec:conclusion}
\textcolor{blue}{In this paper, we present an integrated system EasyCompare to conduct fair performance comparison of GNN models on different frameworks and GPUs. Easycompare contains a DSL with a code tranformer for GNN model definition, and a task running system for model training and log collection. Extensive experiment conducted with Eastcompare shows the different performance of different GNNs, frameworks and GPUs.}

\textcolor{blue}{For future work, we would extend EastCompare to support more GNNs and frameworks for better comparison. In addition, we would like to specify more details of the comparison result and add more comparison settings (e.g. comparison over multi-GPUs) to explore the factors influencing the performance of GNNs.}
